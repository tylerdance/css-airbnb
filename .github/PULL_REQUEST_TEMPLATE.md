**Deliverable Submission**

Please describe your comfort and completeness levels before submitting.
I was comfortable doing the general formatting but ran into problems when I started trying to resize individual images and center text on images.

Comfort Level (1-5): 3

Completeness Level (1-5): 4

Do you have any remaining questions about this deliverable?:
Can I change the size of all images within a div class or do I have to do them individually? 

Why was my formatting getting corrupted when I tried to target specific images?
